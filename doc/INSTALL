  Quick Install:
  **************
    [1] Unzip the distribution and make sure you keep the file-structure

    [2] Edit config.inc.php and enter your mySQL-information

    [3] Upload all files
        Make sure your /pphlogger/admin/ directory is password protected
        If you don't use HTACCESS to protect those files, you need to 
        implement your authentication yourself.

    [4] NEW INSTALLATION:
         Run <www.your-host.com>/pphlogger/admin/setup.php
         in order to create the default settings table and configure
         PowerPhlogger.

        UPGRADE:
         Please read the detailed instructions on 
         http://www.phpee.com/upgrade.php

    [5] now you're ready to start using Power Phlogger!
        To add new user-accounts enter pphlogger/admin/
        Please enter the correct URL, e.g.:

        ------------ CORRECT: ------------
        http://www.domain.com
        http://www.domain.com/about
        ----------------------------------

        ----------- !!WRONG!!: -----------
        http://www.domain.com/about/
        www.domain.com/about
        http://www.domain.com/index.html
        ----------------------------------

    [6] your users will get notified automatically as soon as you create 
        a new account.
        
        here's the code they need to add to their documents (in the body 
        section):

        <script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="pphlogger.js"></script>
        <noscript><img alt="" src="http://www.yourserver.com/pphlogger/pphlogger.php?id=username&st=img"></noscript>


    [7] After a successful installation or upgrade, please make sure that you
        remove the whole /upgrade directory. It will no longer be used and
        for security reasons you should either delete it or protect it
        the same as your /admin directory.



version 2.2.5 - 2003/10/31
