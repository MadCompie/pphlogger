# pphlogger
Fork of Pphlogger to add mysqli extension and replace ereg/eregi functions so it's usable with PHP7.
No development planned, just to keep it working with new PHP/MySQL releases.

Not working at the moment. Lot more mysql_result entries to fix.

Partially working version in test branch. You can log in and some pages are diplaying but you will get 500 errors because not all code is fixed yet.
